# Smart Service for Quality Assessment of Bolting Processes

This repository contains the description of a research project aimed at improving quality assessment in production processes. The study focused on analyzing and classifying bolting cases using advanced data processing techniques and machine learning methods. The project integrates concepts from unsupervised learning, time series analysis, and clustering algorithms to enhance production quality.

## Project Overview

Bolted connections play a critical role in industrial production, ensuring joint integrity and safety. This project addresses the challenges associated with bolted connections in production processes, aiming to classify individual bolting cases as acceptable, not acceptable, or ambiguous. The developed pipeline explores multiple methodologies to improve classification accuracy, enhance data understanding, and optimize quality control.

## Features

- Preprocessing of raw data for better noise handling and alignment.
- Application of clustering and classification algorithms for data analysis.
- Integration of advanced techniques like:
  - Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
  - Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN)
  - Autoencoders for anomaly detection
- Evaluation of cluster quality and classification results.
- Real-time classification capabilities for new data points.

## Key Benefits

- Enhanced detection of problematic bolting cases in production processes.
- Improved understanding of bolting patterns through clustering.
- Reduction in misclassification and ambiguous cases.
- Integration-ready solutions for production processes with appropriate adjustments.
